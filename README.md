# Readme Generator Challange

## What is the purpose?


The purpose of this challange was to create a application that generates a README file for a user.  The user is able to build the README by answering prompts in the terminal.


## How was it accomplished?

This was done by using the NPM Inquirer.

Inquirer gives the user prompts and the data from the promts are added to a new markdown file.

   #### The prompts include

     - The Title
     - The description
     - Installation Methods
     - Usage
     - The license
     - Contribution
     - Test
     - Email
     - GitHub

A badge is created based on the users selected license.

Then the file is then generated and displays all the user inputs, badges, and links.
